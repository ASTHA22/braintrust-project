## Question
"Can you give us some advice on how we should structure our Braintrust organization and projects?"

## Answer
For structuring your Braintrust organization and projects, I recommend:

1. **Organization Structure**:
   - Create separate projects for different LLM use cases or product features
   - Use consistent naming conventions for projects (e.g., `product-feature-evaluation`)

2. **Project Management**:
   - Start with a development project for initial testing
   - Create separate production projects for ongoing evaluation
   - Use tags to categorize different types of prompts or use cases

3. **Evaluation Strategy**:
   - Define clear expected outputs for each dataset
   - Create scorers that align with your specific quality metrics
   - Set up regular evaluation cycles to track model performance over time

This approach will help you maintain a clean organization while scaling your evaluation efforts as your LLM applications grow.
